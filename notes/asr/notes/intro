Intro

In this post, I’ll try to walk you through — in as much detail as possible — the product we built as a team in our startup, Abasis AI.

Special thanks goes to RIF, who gave us the opportunity to join their program and gain unforgettable experience.

Our team was small but focused:

Nikita Markov (me) — responsible for building the ASR model, qwe

Hussein Khadra — responsible for the platform,

Igor Akimov — the originator of the idea.

The Idea

So, what was this project actually about? Oh boy, there’s a lot to tell.

The general idea was to create a Cypriot audio platform — basically a system built on chunks of recorded Cypriot Greek dialect. Users could visit the website and voluntarily help us transcribe this data.

Why? Because as I mentioned in the title, we were pioneers: there were no ASR models or datasets available for Cypriot dialects. Our goal was to empower the community and crowdsource dataset creation.

This was crucial, because our biggest problem was simple: there were no clean, usable datasets to train an ASR model. With the support of people, we wanted to create them ourselves.

ASR Model Vision

When it came to the ASR model itself, the initial idea was to create a commercial system for the parliament, capable of listening to Cypriot Greek and producing transcripts in real time.

There was also a second commercial plan: a Cypriot voice-based auto-responder for restaurants. The vision was that customers could order food at home — without speaking to a human. (Yes, the introvert’s dream!)

Timeline & Effort

The project was short but intense. We had:

6 weeks total,

roughly 40 working days,

and on my side of the table, about 190 hours of hands-on work.
